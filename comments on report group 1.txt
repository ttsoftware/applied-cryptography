1.	Usability – easy to use. What is easy to use for one, might appear complicated to another.
2.	Password generation – secure RNG. Secure is not defined, therefore we can assume that dice roll is used as RNG.
3.	2.1, 2.3 and 2.4 or in general section 2 give contradictions for the consequences of passwords being compromised. Need to look in details, but report looks from company side which is not important. 
4.	Unrealistic attacker model. What happens if we expand attacker model to Dolev – Yao. 
5.	2 factor authentication is not explained nor its clear how it works.
6.	What is really safe password? 8 char is not. Need to check how long it takes to break it.
7.	Replay attack on figure 6. Analyze a bit more, how to prevent this
8.	How to identify the devices.
9.	HTTPS – we can use http over ssl1.0. Its not secure.
10.	There is no detail how token is sent.
11.	Figure 6 is horrible, it just confuses people and not clear how to the protocol is executed
12.	Figure 3. Where the authentication cookie came from.
13.	How Salt works here? How does it help you to have new salt for each password?
14.	Why to use symmetric encryption. Why not to hash it. 
15.	If the web browser is compromised, its critical. Every used password goes clear text. 
16.	SHA 256 / bcrypt.
