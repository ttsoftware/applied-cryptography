1. Formal analysis of secure device pairing protocols.pdf

I think it is a great source for restriction / substitution of traditional attacker model introduced by Dolev and Yao (Dolev-Yao attacker model).
The principle is that in Dolev-Yao attacker model, attacker is controlling all communication medium. In our case it would still be restricted whether by human interaction or smth ELSE???
We could use this paper if we want to go a bit deeper into attack and the protocol itself. Maybe we could even model a protocol in AnB and  try to verify with ofmc, however it would require a bit more detailed knowledge of OFMC capabilities in this field(if we would go for Ubisound idea - 2 channels for 1 protocol)



2. Sondi master thesis.pdf

Well, I admit, it is a crappy and long paper. It goes too much into details not where we need. I would offer to skip this paper for sake of everyone. 
Otherwise a good paper to get an overview how sound waves work in environment (maybe a picture or two could be used to explain background of sound waves).
Another quite okay point, to understand the job of encoding of message using audio channel (numbers are always fancy :) ). 
We can bring another nice point, that audio channels are not reserved / licensed like radio or wifi channels.



3. UbiSOUND.pdf
I like the way of presentating the idea in this paper. The protocol also looks okay, however we can look into opportunities trying to improve it.
Overall - interesting point to use 2 different mediums for exchanging data for DH.
